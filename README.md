The website has been created for the purpose of
listing properties, the realtors can list the properties and the
customers can view/search the properties and can make enquiries
about the properties. The project has been implemented using
the Django Framework and is deployed on cloud using droplet
instance on Digital Ocean. With this site the admin can create
realtors and add listings on their behalf, while the customers can
view the properties and make enquiries using form.
